				The United Nations (UNCDF, UNDP and UNHCR) are working on an initiative to increase access
				to finance to forcibly displaced persons (FDPs) and host communities adjacent to FDP
				locations. The purpose of this survey is to collect information on your organizationâ€™s
				financial services within FDP locations, in order to improve our understanding on the
				factors contributing to constraints in extending financial services. The above UN agencies
				will use this information to understand where the gaps are in the supply and demand of
				financial services within FDP locations, in order to better inform and support future
				programming.
			</p>
			<p>
				The information gathered will be used for the purposes of making policy recommendations, and
				designing financial instruments to improve access to finance in FDP locations. All
				information collected will be treated as strictly confidential. The questions will take
				approximately ONE hour to complete, and your participation is entirely voluntary. If you
				agree to participate, you can stop at any time or choose to skip and question(s) you do not
				want to answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				If in the future you have any question regarding the project and the interview, or concerns
				or complaints about the survey, we welcome you to contact us.
